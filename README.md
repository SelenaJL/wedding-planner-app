# Wedding Planner App

## Goal
This app aims to empower couples to plan their own wedding with clairty, confidence, and joy! It's designed to solve the fragmented, chaotic experience of tracking information accross multuple spreadsheets, notes, emails, etc. by bringing everything into one cohesive space.

## Features
- Users can create a secure account to access their saved data. In the future, they will be able to add other user types with limited access to their account so they can share specific information and collaborate with friends/family/vendors.
- When logged in, users see a dashboard linking to tools for event planning, guest list management, and day-of coorindation. In the future, they will be able to customize this view by hiding tools that aren't relevent to their needs.
- Each tool comes with smart defaults and the ablity to export data to a CSV or PDF. More about the tools below...
